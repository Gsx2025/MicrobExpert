Enterococcus faecium, recognized as a crucial nosocomial pathogen, poses heightened infection risks, especially in immunocompromised patients (Arias et al., 2012; Van Tyne & Gilmore, 2014). In contrast, Lactobacillus reuteri, a beneficial gram-positive bacterium, is known for its numerous health benefits, including digestive aid, immune enhancement, and infection prevention (Mu, Tavella, & Luo, 2018). Intriguingly, the control group exhibited a higher relative abundance of Enterococcus faecium compared to both OKGM and EKGM groups, whereas Lactobacillus reuteri thrived more in the OKGM and EKGM groups than in the control group. This pattern suggests a potential antagonistic relationship between Lactobacillus reuteri and Enterococcus faecium in the gut, supported by findings that Lactobacillus reuteri secretes Reuterin, a broad-spectrum antimicrobial substance, curbing the growth of pathogenic bacteria (Mu et al., 2018).
