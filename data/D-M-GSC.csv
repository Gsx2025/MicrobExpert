obeseity (obese),Ruminococcus,"Previous studies have demonstrated that decreased relative abundance of Akkermansia and increased relative abundance of Bacteroides, Ruminococcus and Parabacteroides in the gut microbiome can improve glucose homeostasis in obese mice and provide a catabolic pathway through a novel mannosylglucose phosphorylase, suggesting that Akkermansia, Bacteroides, Ruminococcus and Parabacteroides may serve an important function in the mechanism of glycometabolism (16?19).",What is the relationship between obeseity (obese) and Ruminococcus?,NA
pneumonia,Streptococcus,"These findings are pertinent in light of our re-analysis of the Monaco et al.cohort which indicates that gut microbiome enrichment of Streptococcus and Veillonella in HIV-infected patients with low CD4+ cell counts is more generalizable and occurs irrespective of pneumonia or HIV treatment, and?may be indicative of traditional airway-colonizing microbes establishing a niche within the gut?or vice versa.",What is the relationship between pneumonia and Streptococcus?,relate
