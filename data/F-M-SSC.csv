water,Escherichia coli,"Outer ear infections (OEs) affect millions of people each year and are associated with significant medical costs.The usage of multiple antibiotics to treat ear contamination is a concern because it can have an environmental impact, especially on soil and water.The increased use of antibiotics has exposed bacterial ecosystems to high concentrations of antibiotic residues.Although there have been efforts to minimize the impact of antibiotics, adsorption methods have yielded better and more viable results, and carbon-based materials are effective for environmental remediation.Graphene oxide (GO) is a versatile material used in various applications such as nanocomposites, antibacterial agents, photocatalysis, electronics, and biomedicine.GO can act as an antibiotic carrier and affect the antibacterial efficacy of antibiotics.However, the processes responsible for the antibacterial activity of GO and antibiotics in treating ear infections are unknown.This study investigates the effect of GO on the antibacterial activity of tetracycline (TT) against Escherichia coli (E.coli)-negative bacteria.Artificial Neural Network-Genetic Algorithm (ANN-GA) was applied to analyze data on the effectiveness of different doses and combinations of graphene oxide and antibiotics in treating ear infections.This study could help identify the most effective treatment protocols and potentially reduce the risk of antibiotic resistance.The R-squared (R2) value, RMSE, and MSE all fall within the proper levels for fitting criteria, with R2 ≥ 0.97 (97%), RMSE ≤ 0.036064, and MSE ≤ 0.00199 (6% variance).The outcomes showed high antimicrobial activity, resulting in a 5-log decline of E.coli.In experiments, GO was shown to coat the bacteria, interfere with their cell membranes, and aid in the prevention of bacterial growth, although this effect was somewhat weaker for E.coli.The concentration and duration at which bare GO can kill E.coli are both important factors.The antibacterial activity of antibiotics can be either boosted or reduced by the presence of GO, depending on the GO's interaction with the antibiotic, the GO's contact with the microbe, and the sensitivity of the bacteria to the antibiotic.The antibacterial efficiency of the combination of GO and antibiotics varies depending on the specific antibiotic and microorganism being targeted.",What is the relation between water and Escherichia coli?
